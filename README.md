# CJAM-MultiNest-sandwich
## Utlizing CJAM and MultiNest, estimate orbital dynamics of Milky Way globular clusters. Globular cluster dispersions data is a compilation of ground-based radial velocities and proper motions from HST and GAIA, as compiled by Baumgardt on the online Galactic Globular Cluster Database (https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/HolgerBaumgardt/globular/).
